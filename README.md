# Relaxing Snow Simulation, using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

This application is a relaxing snow simulation built using the raylib library in C. 

It features a dynamic snowfall effect with customizable settings.

The UI provides interactive controls for adjusting the simulation in real-time.

## Features:
- Change the snow color with a button click.

- Modify snowflake size and density dynamically.

- Adjust wind speed to influence snow movement.

- Toggle a blizzard mode for a more intense snowfall effect.

- Switch between different background colors to set the mood.

- Play or stop background music to enhance the experience.

The snowflakes are rendered using a polygon-based system, with each drop affected by gravity and wind forces, ensuring a natural, flowing effect. 

The simulation runs at 60 FPS.
